## Personal Statement

I am an experienced and knowledgeable IT professional with nearly 30 years of IT and over 15 years of development experience, I am an exceptionally imaginative individual and can visualise abstract and complex ideas.  My personal ethos is "that there is nothing that cannot be achieved, it is just a matter of finding the right solution to the problem".

Learning is the cornerstone of my core values; I constantly explore and challenge the ideas and values I hold. Having Asperger’s, I spend a lot of time in understanding how I am perceived by those around me and value honest and direct feedback, I will always share my thoughts when invited to do so or if I identify a threat or vulnerability in the solutions I am working on.

For my next move I am looking for a role that will allow me to show off my ingenuity and design skills. I want to work for an organization that has inspirational leaders who stand by their values and do what they say they will do.
