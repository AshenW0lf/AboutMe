# About Me

This repo contains public information about me and my career in IT.

Guy is an experienced and knowledgeable IT professional with nearly 30 years of IT and over 15 years of development experience, he is an exceptionally imaginative individual and can visualise abstract and complex ideas.  His personal ethos is that "there is nothing that cannot be achieved, it is just a matter of finding the right solution to the problem".

Learning is the cornerstone of his core values; he constantly explores and challenges the ideas and values he holds. Having Aspergerâ€™s, he spends a lot of time in trying to understand how he is perceived by those around him and he values honest and direct feedback. When invited he will always shares his thoughts or and if he identifies a threat or vulnerability in the solutions he is working on he will bring it to light.
